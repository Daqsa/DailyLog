What is DailyLog?

DailyLog is a personal project that lets me track my daily activities. I log the starting time and ending time of what I did, and I do this for everything I do throughout the day. This helps me objectively see how much time I spent on each task and whether the task was productive or not.The activities accumulate, and each day the program summarizes the total productive time, total rest time, and sleep time of the previous day. Eventually I'm planning to let it graph the time series. 



Using DailyLog

launch logger.py, then write your activity. Your daily log is stored in fullData.csv.
